# Hi there 👋, I'm Brycen

I'm a teenager from Florida that **loves** programming and experiencing new things. Looking towards the future, starting the grind to become a Software Engineer. Learning full stack.

It all started from a simple Discord bot and me being a cheapskate, lol. Look at me now!

## Key fundamentals & thoughts

- All projects should have a README.md and be well documented.
- README-driven development is key to having a well-planned out project.
- `npm install` **never** killed anybody
- Any commit I spit out should be **signed** so you know who just committed untested code to the master branch!
- It's okay to break things! I learned this from being a Minecraft SMP server owner for a year, I was usually the reason the server was down. 😎
- I should probably learn test-driven development already...

### I'm currently hoping to learn

- Java, Minecraft, IBM, and so much more...
- React Native/Flutter, I believe these technologies are amazing, and key to landing a job in Software Engineering.
- Tauri, so I can build cool desktop applications!

 I'm currently looking to collaborate with others looking to become Software Engineers, if you have any suggestions on how to find people just like me, [leave an issue](https://github.com/BrycensRanch/BrycensRanch/issues/new) on my GitHub repository.

### Certifications

- Currently, none! Unless you count the hour of code I did in Elementary. 🤣
- Trust me bro certified
